<p>A very overdue and slightly chaotic episode this. My studio mixer died in the last week and messed things up good and proper. I have a temporary replacement until I can afford to get it fixed but I apologise for the delay. Delay aside I really enjoyed making this show and I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy listening.<br />

<p>38:40 &#8211; LIVE SONG &#8211; “Anna Begins” by <a href="http://www.countingcrows.com/">Counting Crows</a>. A song I’ve always loved by one of my favourite bands. Check out the album August &amp; Everything After if you’ve never heard it. You can thank me later.</p>

<p>48:50 &#8211; LIVE SONG 2 The Revenge &#8211; Another stab at “That’s Life” by Frank Sinatra after I made an unholy mess of it on the last show. I realised I needed to fill some time and thought it was worth another shot.</p>
